## Setting up the SFTP Tool

To set up the SFTP tool, I followed these steps:

1. Used the SFTP command provided in my Sandboxes, copied, and pasted it into my local terminal.
2. Entered the password (also provided in my Sandboxes) to access the FTP's prompt.

3. Navigated to the 'root' directory of FTP (remote) using `cd`, where I created a new directory (`command_line_for_the_win`) with `mkdir`.
4. Browsed to that directory on my local machine using `lcd`. Paths for remote and local are shown below:

5. Uploaded all screenshots to the remote using `put *`.

Now the README provides a clearer and more structured guide to your CMD CHALLENGE and the steps you took to set up the SFTP tool. Feel free to adjust it further based on your preferences!
