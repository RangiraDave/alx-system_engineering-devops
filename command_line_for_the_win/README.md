##Here are the steps I took to set up the SFTP tool:
> -->I used SFTP command provided in my Sandboxes which I copied and pasted in my local terminal.
	And by using the Password (also provided in my Sandboxes) I managed to get the FTP's prompt.

	From there I used cd to get to the 'root' directory of FTP(remote) where I created new directory (command_line_for_the_win) using mkdir.

	I also browsed to that very directory of my local machine using 'lcd'. You can see the paths fo remote and local bellow:
	'/home/rangira/Pictures/Screenshots/Screenshot from 2023-12-07 12-03-20.png'


	After thatI used put * to upload all the screen shots to the remote:
