# The processes and signals tasks directory

## Learning objectives:
What is a PID
What is a process
How to find a processâ€™ PID
How to kill a process
What is a signal
What are the 2 signals that cannot be ignored



0. Write a Bash script that displays its own PID.


1. Write a Bash script that displays a list of currently running processes.

Requirements:

Must show all processes, for all users, including those which might not have a TTY
Display in a user-oriented format
Show process hierarchy


2. Using your previous exercise command, write a Bash script that displays lines containing the bash word, thus allowing you to easily get the PID of your Bash process.

Requirements:

You cannot use pgrep
The third line of your script must be # shellcheck disable=SC2009 (for more info about ignoring shellcheck error here)


3. Write a Bash script that displays the PID, along with the process name, of processes whose name contain the word bash.

Requirements:

You cannot use ps


4. Write a Bash script that displays To infinity and beyond indefinitely.

Requirements:

In between each iteration of the loop, add a sleep 2


5. We stopped our 4-to_infinity_and_beyond process using ctrl+c in the previous task, there is actually another way to do this.

Write a Bash script that stops 4-to_infinity_and_beyond process.

Requirements:

You must use kill
Terminal #0

sylvain@ubuntu$ ./4-to_infinity_and_beyond
To infinity and beyond

Terminated
sylvain@ubuntu$
Terminal #1

sylvain@ubuntu$ ./5-dont_stop_me_now
sylvain@ubuntu$
I opened 2 terminals in this example, started by running my 4-to_infinity_and_beyond Bash script in terminal #0 and then moved on terminal #1 to run 5-dont_stop_me_now. We can then see in terminal #0 that my process has been terminated.



6. Write a Bash script that stops 4-to_infinity_and_beyond process.

Requirements:

You cannot use kill or killall
Terminal #0

sylvain@ubuntu$ ./4-to_infinity_and_beyond
To infinity and beyond
To infinity and beyond
To infinity and beyond

Terminated
sylvain@ubuntu$ 
Terminal #1

sylvain@ubuntu$ ./6-stop_me_if_you_can
sylvain@ubuntu$ 
I opened 2 terminals in this example, started by running my 4-to_infinity_and_beyond Bash script in terminal #0 and then moved on terminal #1 to run 6-stop_me_if_you_can. We can then see in terminal #0 that my process has been terminated.



7. Write a Bash script that displays:

To infinity and beyond indefinitely
With a sleep 2 in between each iteration
I am invincible!!! when receiving a SIGTERM signal
Make a copy of your 6-stop_me_if_you_can script, name it 67-stop_me_if_you_can, that kills the 7-highlander process instead of the 4-to_infinity_and_beyond one.

Terminal #0

sylvain@ubuntu$ ./7-highlander
To infinity and beyond
To infinity and beyond
I am invincible!!!
To infinity and beyond
I am invincible!!!
To infinity and beyond
To infinity and beyond
To infinity and beyond
I am invincible!!!
To infinity and beyond
^C
sylvain@ubuntu$ 
Terminal #1

sylvain@ubuntu$ ./67-stop_me_if_you_can 
sylvain@ubuntu$ ./67-stop_me_if_you_can
sylvain@ubuntu$ ./67-stop_me_if_you_can
sylvain@ubuntu$ 
I started 7-highlander in Terminal #0 and then run 67-stop_me_if_you_can in terminal #1, for every iteration we can see I am invincible!!! appearing in terminal #0.



8. Write a Bash script that kills the process 7-highlander.

Terminal #0

sylvain@ubuntu$ ./7-highlander 
To infinity and beyond
To infinity and beyond
To infinity and beyond
To infinity and beyond
Killed
sylvain@ubuntu$ 
Terminal #1

sylvain@ubuntu$ ./8-beheaded_process
sylvain@ubuntu$ 
I started 7-highlander in Terminal #0 and then run 8-beheaded_process in terminal #1 and we can see that the 7-highlander has been killed.



9. Write a Bash script that kills the process 7-highlander.

Terminal #0

sylvain@ubuntu$ ./7-highlander 
To infinity and beyond
To infinity and beyond
To infinity and beyond
To infinity and beyond
Killed
sylvain@ubuntu$ 
Terminal #1

sylvain@ubuntu$ ./8-beheaded_process
sylvain@ubuntu$ 
I started 7-highlander in Terminal #0 and then run 8-beheaded_process in terminal #1 and we can see that the 7-highlander has been killed.


## Happy coding!
