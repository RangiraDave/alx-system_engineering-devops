# This directory contains a script to correct the following issue.

## Background Context
The Webstack debugging series will train you in the art of debugging. Computers and software rarely work the way we want (that’s the “fun” part of the job!).

Being able to debug a webstack is essential for a Full-Stack Software Engineer, and it takes practice to be a master of it.

In this debugging series, broken/bugged webstacks will be given to you, the final goal is to come up with a Bash script that once executed, will bring the webstack to a working state. But before writing this Bash script, you should figure out what is going on and fix it manually.

Let’s start with a very simple example. My server must:

have a copy of the /etc/passwd file in /tmp
have a file named /tmp/isworking containing the string OK
Let’s pretend that without these 2 elements, my web application cannot work.

Let’s go through this example and fix the server.

Then my answer file would contain:

```
sylvain@ubuntu:~$ cat answerfile
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Fix my server with these magic 2 lines
cp /etc/passwd /tmp/
echo OK > /tmp/isworking
sylvain@ubuntu:~$
```

Be sure to read the Docker concept page

In this first debugging project, you will need to get Apache(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_HTTP_Server) to run on the container and to return a page containing Hello Holberton when querying the root of it.

```
vagrant@vagrant:~$ docker run -p 8080:80 -d -it holbertonschool/265-0
47ca3994a4910bbc29d1d8925b1c70e1bdd799f5442040365a7cb9a0db218021
vagrant@vagrant:~$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                   COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                  NAMES
47ca3994a491        holbertonschool/265-0   "/bin/bash"         3 seconds ago       Up 2 seconds        0.0.0.0:8080->80/tcp   vigilant_tesla
vagrant@vagrant:~$ curl 0:8080
curl: (52) Empty reply from server
vagrant@vagrant:~$
```
Here we can see that after starting my Docker container, I curl the port 8080 mapped to the Docker container port 80, it does not return a page but an error message. Note that you might also get the error message curl: (52) Empty reply from server.


```
vagrant@vagrant:~$ curl 0:8080
Hello Holberton
vagrant@vagrant:~$
```
After connecting to the container and fixing whatever needed to be fixed (here is your mission), you can see that curling port 80 return a page that contains Hello Holberton. Paste the command(s) you used to fix the issue in your answer file.
