=> downloaded the script
=> seen the man for tcpdump
=> opened two terminal windows
=> On first I started "sudo tcpdump -i host smtp.sendgrid.net -w logz.pcap" command
=> In another window I ran the script(to sniff the packets from)
=> opped logz.pcap in the wireshark
=> looked where it is written pass(Or password)
=> Took the value and used "echo 'value(bXlwYXNzd29yZDk4OTgh)' | base64 --decode" to get the actaul password.
=> put the password in the 0-sniffing file.
